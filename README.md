## Description
In a world where streaming platforms are the new method of media consumption, we think that there are too many providers which can make the media search process difficult. Listably is a media consumption tracker where a user can find movies and TV shows and where they can watch it online. Our website helps users keep a consolidated list of the media they would like to track on a simple dashboard.
